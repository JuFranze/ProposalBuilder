Project Outline
--------
Every company creates proposals differently. Designing a bespoke proposal response containing all information requested, calculations, graphs, data points, visualizations, in the correct tone of voice, and with a company's personal touch to stand out from competitors _can be a time-consuming process_.

The tool we have created will help to accelerate the creation process and provide a modular system that can be tailored in complexity, prompt, and workflow to meet different needs of companies. Our solution uses the Azure OpenAI Service to automatically interpret the request by ingesting Request for Proposal (RfP) documents. It will then suggest a possible structure for a response and allow the user to generate textual content for each of the sections.

Once the user is satisfied, the tool will then allow them to export the content to PowerPoint, Word, Adobe InDesign etc. to finalise the response.

Process
--------
* **Ingest** - The tool will allow users to upload all background documents for an RfP. Including emails, cover letters, technical questionnaires, company materials, and more.
* **Analyse** - The tool will then crawl the documents, and retrieve information from the web on the company in question to provide information to support the proposal.
* **Generate** - Using the Azure OpenAI Service, a suggested structure for a response is generated, starting with a cover letter.
* **Modify** - The user can then re-order the structure, discard sections, make changes, and even use AI to generate new textual content.
* **Export** - The user can then choose to export the content to publish the proposal.

Benefits
---------
This tool will decrease the time it takes to prepare and structure an RfP response. By using the Azure OpenAI Service to automate the research and provide a suggested structure, a team will never need to start from a blank page again. All generated textual content will adhere to the company's correct tone of voice which will save proof-reading time at the end of the process by the brand team.
